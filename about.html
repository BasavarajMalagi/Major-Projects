    <h2>Hello guys...  </h2>
    <h3>I am <span>Basavaraj Malagi.</span> i am a Computer Science Student from Angadi Institute of Technology And Management Belagavi. 'm a very interesting fellow, who's very hard to understand. A selfless attitude towards anyone whom I come across with. I'm of a very friendly nature and love to be with people who aren't selfish.

      Ambitious can do anything to achieve my aim. I'm of a very competitive nature but love to find good in everything I see. According to me, there are many things that make us depressed or upset, but that doesn't mean that we stop living. In fact, problems are a sign of life. They make us believe that we are living. The only people who have no problems are in cemeteries. So we shall be fortunate that we have problems. It enhances our minds. This is the philosophy of my life.<p></hI3>
